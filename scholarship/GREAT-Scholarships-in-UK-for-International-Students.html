                                                            The GREAT Scholarships program provides students from 14 countries with an opportunity to receive £10,000 towards their tuition fees for a wide range of one-year taught postgraduate courses. In the academic year 2023-24, a total of 200 scholarships are offered by 49 universities across England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.

The GREAT Scholarships are available to students from the following countries: Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Thailand, Turkey, and Vietnam. To find out which scholarships are available in your country, you can click on the links provided.

Each scholarship is jointly funded by the UK government's GREAT Britain Campaign and the British Council, in collaboration with participating UK higher education institutions. As part of the program, all GREAT scholars will be invited to a welcome event in the first semester and a networking event in the second semester. This initiative aims to promote educational opportunities and strengthen ties between the UK and these countries, providing deserving students with financial support to pursue their postgraduate studies in the United Kingdom.

								Academic Recognition: Winning a scholarship is an academic achievement that demonstrates a student's academic excellence and potential, which can be beneficial when applying for future academic programs or job opportunities.
								Networking: Scholarships can offer networking opportunities with other scholarship recipients, alumni, and donors, providing students with valuable connections in their field of study.
