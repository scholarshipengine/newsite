                                                            The MTN Science and Technology Scholarship (STS) is a program specifically designed to support students in the field of science and technology. The application is open to two groups of students: those who have completed their second semester 200 level examinations and will be advancing to the 300 level, and students who are currently in their 300 level of study. This flexibility acknowledges the variation in academic calendars among public tertiary institutions. By considering students at different stages of their academic journey, the MTN STS aims to provide opportunities for a wider range of students pursuing science and technology disciplines, ensuring that deserving individuals receive support and recognition for their dedication and achievements.

                                                            The MTN Scholarship for Blind Students (SBS) is a dedicated program aimed at supporting blind students pursuing their education in Nigerian Public Tertiary Institutions, including universities, polytechnics, and colleges of education. The application is open to blind students at both the 200 and 300 level of their studies. However, for blind students specifically studying Law, which is a five-year course, only those at the 300 level are eligible to apply for the MTN Scholarship. This program recognizes the unique challenges faced by blind students and aims to provide them with financial assistance and support to further their education. By offering opportunities at different academic levels, the MTN SBS ensures that blind students across various stages of their academic journey have the chance to receive this valuable scholarship and pursue their educational goals.
