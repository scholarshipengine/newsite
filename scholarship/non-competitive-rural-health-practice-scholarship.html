This project should involve collaborating with a rural-serving organization or addressing a rural issue, as determined suitable by the instructor. Summer enrollees will have the opportunity to take one of the aforementioned classes based on availability.</li>
                                                                <li style="color: white;">As a requirement, students must commit to conducting their Applied Practice Experience (APE) in a public health or healthcare facility situated in a geographic region classified as rural. These designated rural sites are identified by utilizing the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) rural analyzer: https://data.hrsa.gov/tools/rural-health. The MPH program will provide support in finding an appropriate site for the APE. Eligibility is extended to students residing in urban areas as well, although they are advised to utilize the aforementioned website to determine their proximity to such rural sites.</li>
                                                                <li style="color: white;">The facilities or clinics where students are hosted will be requested to submit a brief statement to the Executive Vice President and Director of the F. Marie Hall Institute for Rural and Community Health, highlighting the impact made by the student during their time at the facility</li>
                                                                <li style="color: white;">To retain the scholarship, students must maintain satisfactory progress on their MPH degree plan and uphold a good academic record, which entails maintaining a GPA of 3.0 or higher. If a student falls into academic probation, the scholarship will be forfeited for the subsequent semester. However, there is an opportunity for scholarship renewal once the student achieves a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher.</li>
